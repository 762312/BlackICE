EVTDESC1003; By the Latvian–Soviet Peace Treaty of 1920, a part of Ostrovsky Uyezd, including Pytalovo, was passed to Latvia. In 1925, Latvians renamed it Jaunlatgale, which it was known as until 1938, when the name was changed to Abrene. In 1933, it was granted town status. During the interwar period, it was the administrative center of Abrene District. After the annexation of Latvia by the Soviet Union in 1940, the town originally remained a part of the Latvian SSR. During World War II, the town was occupied by the German Army from July 5, 1941 until July 22, 1944. On January 16, 1945, the town and the surrounding areas were transferred to Pskov Oblast of the Russian SFSR and Pytalovsky District was established. At the same time, the town's original name (Pytalovo) was restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
