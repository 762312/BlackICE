EVTNAME33403;Comando Truppe di Zara.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33403;"Comando Truppe del Presidio di Zara" was created on Janary, 1st 1936. This garrison force was set up to defend the city and port of Zara, an italian enclave in the Yougoslavian territory.\n\nThe originality of this unit was to merge various types of italian troops: Guardia alla Frontiera, Milizia Voluntaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale, and three different forces from the Regio Esercito – Carabinieri Reali, Bersaglieri and armored troops, including L 5/21 tanks and Lanzia 1ZM armored cars.\nAt the outbreak of hostilities with Yougoslavia in april 1942, the division enter in combat actions, occupying cities of Zaravecchia, Nona, Obrovazzo, Bencovazzo, Scardona and finally Tenin were it made junction with the 2a Armata , especially the 133rd Armored Division "Littorio", capturing 2,200 prisonners.

EVTNAME33406;Ordinamento Baistrocchi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33406;Federico Baistrocchi (1871-1947) was appointed as Chief of the Army General Staff in October 1st 1934. Highly decorated artillery officer of the Great War, Baistrocchi supported the fascist movement in Naples and assured Mussolini his troops won't intervene against him. He was elected three times (in 1924, 1929 and 1934) as Deputy for the PNF. Supporter of the fascist power, he made a rapid military ascension, becoming in July 1933 Undersecretary of State for the Ministry of War, held by Mussolini himself, before becoming Chief of Staff of the Royal Army from October 1st, 1934 to October 7th, 1936. \nBaistrocchi issued on November 14th, 1933 the so-called "Ordinamento Baistrocchi" (Baistrocchi's reform), a deep reform of the Italian Army. This reform focused on modernisation of weapons, motorisation and mechanization of troops, dividing forces between standing and defensive ones like the Guardia alla Frontiera. Baistrocchi organized the logistical warfare in Ethiopia and favorise the constitution of MVSN divisions for the war.\n\nBaistrocchi's program, perhaps too ambitious, was only partially implemented.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33407;Appoint Alberto Pariani as Chief of General Staff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33407;In october 1936, germanophile Alberto Pariani (1876-1955) replaced Federico Baistrocchi as Chief of the Army General Staff and Undersecretary of War, after Baistrocchi's "promotion", motivated by a conflict with Marshall Pietro Badoglio and different political views in the involvment of Italian troops in the Spanish Civil War. Pariani fought WW1 and occupied various fonctions as military attaché in Albania, general commander of the 18a Divisione 'Brennero' and Deputy Chief of General Staff from 1934 to 1936. He was defending the concept of "Guerra di rapido corso" (war of mobility) like other generals from different countires: Basil Liddell-Hart, Heinz Guderian, Mikhaïl Toukhatchevky or Charles de Gaulle... Pariani led a deep reform of the Italian Army, based on the field experiences in Ethiopia and Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33408;Ordinamento Pariani.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33408;By Decreto n° 2095 of December 22nd, 1938 (called "Ordinamento Pariani") all infantry divisions of the Regio Esercito were set on a new standard: one of the three infantry regiment was removed and replaced by one 81 mm mortar battalion, one At-company and one anti-aircraft battery. These binary divisions, thought to be more able to act rapidly were tested during the greats manœuvers of summer 1937 and 1938. Mussolini was not convincted by this reform but finally accept Pariani's proposal, which was increasing the total number of divisions of the Army from 31 to 51 Infantry Divisions along the new semi-motorized, motorized and armored divisions created. To compensate the lack of power, each division was assigned a battalion and then a brigade of MVSN Blackshirts.\n\n§RNote for player: this event will lock the technology that allows increasing brigade size.§B;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33409;Pietro Badoglio's warning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33409;Alberto Pariani was suddenly removed as Undersercretary of War on November 13th, 1939 by Mussolini for not being equal to the challenge. He was replaced by Rodolfo Graziani, one of Mussolini favorite maschalls. Pariani's reform is frequently used to explain the Italian defeats in WW2, turning all divisions to something unfitted for a long fight. In fact, the main issue remained the lack of  motor vehicules, updated tanks, anti-aircraft and antitank weapons because italian industry was unable to produce the required equipments. Removing Pariani's couldn't change the global situation and in early 1940, the Regio Esercito was not ready for war. Field Marshall Pietro Badoglio send a letter to Mussolini on April, 9th 1940 to warn him about the risks of entering in war alongside Germany. He underlined the lack of available artillery, anti-aicraft guns and effective antitank guns as the Army was using the 47/32 AT gun, only effective at close range. A significant amount of equipment had been lost in Ethiopia and Spain. Badoglio estimated that the global efficiency of the army was at 40%.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The italian response was immediate: for two days, security forces were given a "carte blanche" to kill any Ethiopian in the city. Carabinieri, armymen and Blackshirts killed people blindly, using daggers, truncheons, hand grenades, burning native houses with petrol, screaming "Duce! Duce!

EVTNAME33489;Achille Starace 'Colonna Celere'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33489;Achille Starace (1889-1945) was a hierarch of the Fascist Party - or PNF. Former Bersagliere during WW1, he rapidly became a supporter of Benito Mussolini and became vice-secretary of the Party in 1921. In 1935, Starace was authorized to participate in the Italian invasion of Ethiopia.\nHe was given the command of a mixed group of Blackshirts and Bersaglieri being assembled in Asmara, totalizing 3000 men and 500 motor vehicules. This truck transportable column prepare to advance over rough tracks to seize Gondar, capital of Beremder Province. "L’uomo pantera" (the panther man) managed to cover 120 km in three days, taking Gondar in the morning of the first of april 1936 and reaching lake Tana only two days later, securing the border with British Sudan.\nStarace wrote his achievments in his book, 'La marcia su Gondar della colonna celere' where you can find an extract of the speech he gave to his men :\n "Soldiers, this is the most risky, most difficult and most important venture of the campaign. Don't waste a shot. (...) Britain is a rich country, Italy is a poor country, but the people of poor countries have hard muscles. The only way to explain the action of the English is that they thought they had only to mass a war fleet in the Mediterranean and Premier Mussolini would take off his hat and bow in submission.Instead he reared up like a thoroughbred horse and sent his soldiers into Africa. Viva Il Duce!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33490;Achille Starace and the ring of fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33490;After Ethiopia, Achille Starace came back to Italy to assume its functions: President of the Italian Olympic Comity and... National Secretary of the PNF. Loyal and obedient, he was appointed here despite of its limitated intellectual capacities. When Marshall Balbo qualified him as an idiot, Mussolini answered that an idiot he was, for sure, but some obdedient idiot.\nStarace is specially and more significantly remembered also for a policy of enrollment of the Italian people (either young or not) in fascist party-linked organizations like Opera Balilla, Figli della lupa, Avanguardisti, Giovane fascista and the labour-related Organizzazione del Dopolavoro.\nStarace was a sports fanatic doing hours of sport, particulary equitation, everyday. He is remembered for such unlikely sports stunts as jumping through a fire circle at the Marmi Stadium in 1938 or horse jumping over a saloon car.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33491;Achille Starace's end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33491;Starace rapidly ended its political career, being mocked by almost everyone in Italy. A "dire jester" for Field Marshall Emilio de Bono, "Harlequin of an equestrian show" for head of Secret Police Arturo Bocchini, Starace became the object of political satire and popular jokes under fascism, especially from students.\nAfter being assigned to the general Staff of the MVSN in 1939, he participated in the desastrous Greek campaign were he was wounded and then evacuated. Mussolini removed him from its command and he was never trusted again by the fascist rulers. He ended captured and executed by the Partisans on April 28th, 1945.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
