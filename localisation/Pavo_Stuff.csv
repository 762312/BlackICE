EVTDESC123456;Sergio Bresciani (1924.7.2-1942.9.4) was one of the youngest Medaglia d'Oro (Gold Medal, the highest Italian valour decoration) ever. Also known as the 'eroe fanciullo' (hero child) he tried to volunteer at 15 at first, but succeded to do so only after several failed attempts, when he turned 17. As part of the 3o Rgt. Articelere 'P.A.D.A.' (a fast-moving artillery regiment) he earned for himself the admiration of both his comrades as well as of Rommel, that personally decorated him with the EK II after Op. Battleaxe, when he also learned an Italian Silver Medal. In late 1941 he was personally involved in the destruction of 20 Matilda Mk.II tanks near El-Adem. He died because his truck hit a mine in 1942, during the second battle of El-Alamein. He was posthmously awarded the EK I class in 1943.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
