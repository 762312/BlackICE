EVTDESC33301;1ère Division d'Infanterie Marocaine (colonial infantry from Morocco) was set up at the end of October 1939 upon active regiments stationned in Morocco. It was then transfered to the Metroplitan area and assigned under the 4ème Corps d'Armée (1ère Armée). Its initial commander was general Sylvestre Audet, rapidly replaced by general Albert Mellier when Audet took command of the expeditionary force sent in Norway.1ère DM participated in the action against german advanding armored forces at Gembloux and Lille before withdrawing to Dunkerque.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33302;Formation of the 9ème Division d'Infanterie Coloniale;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33302;9ème Division d'Infanterie Coloniale (colonial infantry) was set up in June 1940 and put under command of general Marcel Pellet when the Battle of France ended.

EVTNAME33303;Formation of the 40ème Division d'Infanterie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33303;40ème Division d'Infanterie was set up on May 30th, 1940 by assembling the remnants of two light infantry brigades sent to Norway (1ère DLCh, 2ème DLCh). Despite its name, it was a mountain infantry division. It was placed under the command of general Maurice Durand, former commander of the 2ème DLCh, and assigned to the General High Command as a reserve unit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33304;Formation of the 44ème Division d'Infanterie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33304;44ème Division d'Infanterie was set up on March 1st, 1940. Despite its name, most of its regiments were moutain infantry. It was placed under the command of general Robert Boissau and assigned to the 5ème Armée.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33305;French Mobilisation - Type B reserve divisions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33305;French Army started its mobilisation from August 21st to September 3rd, 1939. From 20 active divisions, it rose to 86 divisions, including new formations and reserve units. Mobilisation happened in three times:\n\nFirst, active divisions were sent to the frontier to counter a possible attack, allowing the reserve divisions to be set up.\nThen, mobilisation centers started to form Type A reserve divisions, by duplication of active divisions. These units have half their strength formed by reservists aged from 20 to 40 years old. Equipments were very similar to active divisions.\nLast, mobilisation centers started to form Type B reserve divisions.\nType B reserve divisions were created from scratch with reservists from 40 to 48 years old. They had a very low percentage of officers from the active army, equiped with outdated armament, lacking of AT-guns. These divisions were not at full strenght (80-85%) and were assigned to garrison, building of farming duties. Although they were not designed to fight on first line, Type B reserve divisions were finally thrown to combat because of the lack of troops to stop german penetrations.\n\n\n§RNote for player: Type A reserve divisions are already in the starting OOB. This event will fire Type B reserve divisions in 2 times.§R;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33306;French Type-B reserve divisions for TONE;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME33308;Formation of Divisions Légères de Cavalerie (DLC - Cavalry Light Divisions);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33308;In November 1939, French High Command decide to transform its three remaining Cavalry Divisions into five lighter divisions (Divisions Légères de Cavalerie) in order to delay ennemy advancing troops. Former Cavalry Divisions from type 1932, partially motorised, consisted in two cavalry brigades each with two regiments, and were supported by motorized troops: one artillery regiment, one motorized infantry battalion, one armored car regiment.\nResulting from this composition, different manoeuvre speeds (8 km/h and 30 km/h respectively) and supply requirements made the 'Divisions de Cavalerie' unwieldy units, derisively nicknamed 'pétrole-picotin' (oil and oats) or 'crottin et cambouis' (horse dung and dirty grease) divisions.\nThe newly formed DLC (early February 1940) were supposed to be more efficient, organized into two different parts grouping cavalry elements on one side and motorized troops on the other. Each division had a theoric total of 16 Panhard 178 armored cars, 22 Renault 35-ZT armored cars and 16 H35 light support tanks.\n\n1ère Division de Cavalerie was transformed into 1ère DLC and 1ère Brigade de Cavalerie\n2ème Division de Cavalerie was transformed into 2ème DLC and 4ème DLC\n3ème Division de Cavalerie was transformed into 3ème DLC and 5ème DLC\nOn March 1940, remaining cavalry regiments stationned in Africa were merged to form the 6ème DLC.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33309;Formation of the 1ère Division Légère de Cavalerie (DLC);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33309;1ère DLC was formed form the structure of 1ère Division de Cavalerie (DC) on February 10th, 1940. It was assigned to 9ème Armée in Saint-Mihiel and placed under the command of general Jacques Marie Toussaint d'Arras, commander of the former division.\nRemaining troops were used to build the 1ère Brigade de Cavalerie assigned to the 2ème Armée.\nIn May 1940, 1ère DLC participated in the delaying actions in the Ardenne. After 10 days of combat, the division was almost destroyed and its remnants are used to form the 4ème DLM.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33310;Formation of 2ème DLC and 4ème DLC;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33310;Both divisions were set up from the former 2ème Division de Cavalerie on February 10th, 1940. 2ème DLC was formed in Montmédy, under the command of general André Berniquet and assigned to the 2ème Armée. The division also participated in the delaying manoeuver in the Ardenne, fighting in Sedan. Then it was involved in De Gaulle’s counterattack on Abbeville. Placed in defensive stance along the Somme, the division was trapped and destroyed near Saint-Valéry-de-Caux.\n4ème DLC was formed in Vitry-le-François and assigned to the 9ème Armée, like the 1ère DLC. Its commander was general Paul Louis Arthur Barbe, KIA on May 15th, 1940. In June, as the division was almost destroyed, its remnants were used to form the 7ème DLM.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33311;Formation of 3ème DLC and 5ème DLC;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33311;Both divisions were set up from the former 3ème Division de Cavalerie on February 10th, 1940. 3ème DLC was formed in Longwy under the command of general Robert Petiet and assigned to 3ème Armée. The division was assigned delaying actions in Luxembourg and set up defenses along the Somme and the Seine.\n5ème DLC was formed in Saint Menehould on February 25th, 1940 and attached to the 2ème Armée. Its commander was general Marie Jacques Henri Chanoine and fought alongside 2ème DLC and 1ère Brigade de Cavalerie until its complete destruction near Saint-Valéry-de-Caux.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33312;Formation of 6ème Division Legere de Cavalerie in North Africa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33312;6ème DLC was created on March 1st, 1940 in Algeria by assembling various cavalry regiments stationned there. This division was commanded by general Denis Marie Joseph Félix Clouet de Pesruches and assigned in June to South Tunisian Front to prevent a attack from Italian forces stationned in Libya.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33313;Formation of Divisions Légères Mécaniques (DLM);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33313;DLM were the first french armored units to be constituted, coming from the army cavalry branch. Motorisation of cavalry units started in the mid-thirthies under the impulse of Jean Flavigny, director of Cavalry and Logistics between 1932 and 1936. 1ère Division Légère Mécanique was set up in July 1935 in Reims from the former 4ème Division de Cavalerie and placed under the command of general Francois Picard.\nThis new type of division was composed of two armored brigades - one made of two tank regiments, the second made of motorized elements (infantry, recon, artillery) - and various support units. It totalizes 96 Somua S-35 medium tanks, 94 Hotchkiss H-35/H39 light tanks, 48 Panhard AMD 178 and 69 Renault 35-ZT armored cars. Each division was composed of 10.400 men and the adjective 'light' was only meaning the ability of fast movement. For all these reasons, the DLM divisions were very close in strength and missions to their German counterpart, the early Panzerdivisionen.\n\n2ème Division Légère Mécanique was set up before war in Lyon upon the basis of the former 5ème Division de Cavalerie.\n3ème Division Légère Mécanique was set up in February 1940.\n4ème Division Légère Mécanique was set up in early June 1940 from the remnants of 1ère DLC.\n7ème Division Légère Mécanique was set up in early June 1940 from the remnants of 4ème DLC.\nPlans to convert all DLC into DLM equipped with Somua-S35 medium tanks were interupted by the fate of war in the West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33314;Formation of 2ème Division Légère Mécanique (2ème DLM);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33314;2ème Division Légère Mécanique was set up in Lyon in 1937 upon the basis of the former 5ème Division de Cavalerie. Its first commander until 1939 was Félix René Altmayer until he was replaced by general Gabriel Bougrain in September.\n2ème DLM was assigned to Cavalry Corps alongside the 3ème DLM. Between May 12th and 14th, René Prioux's cavalry corps faced Erich Hoepner's XVI. Armee-Korps (mot.) made of 3. Panzerdivision and 4. Panzerdivision in Hannut, Belgium. It was the largest tank battle of the campaign and, at this time, the largest clash of tanks in armored warfare history. Despite heavy losses (half inflicted by the Luftwaffe), 2ème DLM succed in delaying the german advance, destroying many tanks. It was then assigned to cover the retreat of French 1ère Armée before being encircled in the Dunkerque Pocket.\nRemnants of the 2ème DLM who were embarqued in Dunkerque were used to reform the division, south to Paris, and assigned to the newly formed 10ème Armée. 2ème DLM fought in defensive stance until the Armistice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33315;Formation of 3ème Division Légère Mécanique (3ème DLM);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33315;3ème Division Légère Mécanique was set up in Saint-Quentin in February 1940 under the command of general Jean Léon Albert Langlois, former chief of staff of 2ème Armée. In early March, the division was assigned to René Prioux's Cavalry Corps, replacing the 1ère DLM sent to the 7ème Armée.\nThe division also took heavy losses in the tank battle of Hannut and ended like its sister division, 2ème DLM.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33316;Formation of 4ème Division Légère Mécanique(4ème DLM);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33316;4ème Division Légère Mécanique was to be set up in July 1940 by transformation of the former 1ère DLC. Due to the rapid advance of german forces, constitution of this division was interrupted to send all armored forces to the front. Half of its equipments were finally sent to the newly formed 4ème Division Cuirassée (DCR) under command of general Charles de Gaulle.\nThe other part was assembled as a 'Groupement mécanique de marche' under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Pierre de Langle de Cary and sent to the 7th Army.\n\n§RHere you have the possibility to create the full division or go historical.§R;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME33320;Formation of 6ème Division Légère Mécanique (6ème DLM);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33320;6ème Division Légère Mécanique was to be created by transformation of the former 3ème Division Légère de Cavalerie. This unit was never formed, due to the Armistice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33321;Send armored reinforcements to Tunisia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33321;In April 1938, French High Command started to consider the threat of italian forces in Libya and decided to send armored reinforcements to the Front Sud Tunisien. The Groupe de Bataillons de Chars (GBC) 521 was constituted of three battalions (61st, 65th, 67th) totalizing 135 Renault D1 infantry support tanks.\nAlthough these tanks were already outdated, they saw combat during the Torch operation (1942) and later in the allied campaign against Axis forces in Tunisia (1943).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33322;Formation of the 'Groupement tactique d'expérience';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33322;Alongside the newly formed DLM, French High command ordered the formation in Nancy of an experimental unit, amalgam of different detached units assembled to work on a new concept of tank utilisation. This group was composed of 4 heavy tanks battalions from various units, equiped with Renault B1 and B1 Bis, two batallions of motorized infantry and all terrain motorised artillery regiment with 105 mm guns.\nThis experience and the german armored warfare in Poland conduct General Gamelin to order in september 1939 the formation of the two french armored brigades from this tactical group. These two armored brigades were soon transformed into the first french armored divisions: 1ère et 2ème Divisions Cuirassées de Réserve (DCR).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33323;Formation of the 1ère Division Cuirassee de Réserve (1ère DCR - armored division);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33323;1ère DCR was formed on January 16th, 1940 in Châlons from the 1ère Brigade Cuirassée. Its initial commander was general Marie Germain Christian Bruneau and the division was attached to the 1ère Armée (general Blanchard). It was the most powerfull french army unit when it entered in Belgium on May 10th, 1940 with some 90 Hotchkiss H-35 light tanks and 70 B1-Bis heavy tanks. Slowed by refugees and lack of fuel, 1ère DCR missed the opportunity to smash Erwin Rommel and its 7. Panzedivision on May 14th when it was vunerable. During the battle of Flavion, south of Charleroi (May 15th), the division was engaged by the 5. and 7. Panzerdivision, suffered heavy losses (100 tanks) but managed to knock out from 60 to 100 german tanks and 20 armored cars.\nMost of the french losses were provocated by lack of fuel, communications, recon capacities and adequate anti-aircraft guns. General Bruneau and its staff were captured on May 18th near Bantouzelle.\nThe division was reinforced in late May and placed under the command of general Marie Joseph Edmond Welvert. 1ère DCR covered the retreat of the 7ème Armée and was disbanded after the Armistice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33324;Formation of the 2ème Division Cuirassée de Réserve (2ème DCR);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33324;2ème DCR was created on January 16th, 1940 like the 1ère DCR. It was assigned to 1ère Armée and then to the 1er Groupement Cuirassé, a GHQ reserve force. Thought to engage ennemy tank formations and motorized units, 2ème DCR was thrown against german troops piercing the front at Dinant. Facing Guderian’s XIX. Armee Korps, general Albert Charles Emile Buche engaged its tanks in small formations because all the division wasn’t transfered to the front in time. One week later, the 2ème DCR had cessed to exist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33325;Formation of the 3ème Division Cuirassée de Réserve (3ème DCR);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33325;3ème DCR was formed on March 20th, 1940 in Chatou, near Paris. This armored division was placed under the command of general Georges Louis Marie Brocard and assigned to the 1er Groupement Cuirassé. It was then assembled at Mourmelon and sent to combat on May 14th.\n3ème DCR participated to the battle of Stonne (May 15th-27th) under the command of Jean Flavigny’s 21ème Corps d'Armée. Flavigny was tasked to take back the village of Stonne, a strategic position in the heights south of the german bridgehead of Sedan over the river Meuse. Alongside 3ème Division d’Infanterie Motorisée, french tankers equiped with the powerfull B1-Bis heavy tank attacked the VI. Armee-Korps and XIV. Armee-Korps (mot.), composed of the 10. Panzerdivision, IR Grossdeutschland, 16. and 24. Infanterie-Divisionen. Germany lost 26.000 soldiers for 7.500 french soldiers which is the coslty battle in the west for the Reich. Generals Herman Hoth and Heinz Guderian jugged how severe was this battle but even if the village was captured and recaptured 17 times, it was firmly hold by german troops on May 17th, preventing Flavigny to lead a strong attack on the Sedan’s bridghead.\nAfter the battle of Stonne, 3ème DCR was forced to abandon almost all its heavy tanks and then retreated south until the Armistice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33326;Formation of the 4ème Division Cuirassée de Réserve (4ème DCR);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33326;4ème DCR was formed on May 10th, 1940, when Germany launched its offensive toward Western Countries. This ad hoc unit was set up adding all available tank batallions from May 10th to May 27th. It reached a total of 364 armored vehicules : 58 B1-Bis heavy tanks, 44 D2 and 39 Somua S-35 medium tanks, 135 R-35, 40 H39 light tanks, and 48 Panhard AMD 178 armored cars.\nUnder the leadership of Colonel Charles de Gaulle, the division enter in action on May 17th at Montcornet and Laon, pushing back german troops. From May 28th to May 30th, 4ème DCR fought to take back the Abbeville salient and relieve the allied forces trapped in Dunkerque. Despite heavy losses, the Bavarian 57. ID managed to repulse the advancing french tanks using its 3,7 mm Pak 36 and 88mm Flak guns.\nAfter its failure, de Gaulle enter the French government and the 4ème DCR was attached to the 2ème Groupement Cuirassé (10ème Armée). In June, the armored division fought to protect the retreating troops on the river Loire until the Armistice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33327;Corps Expéditionnaire Français en Scandinavie (CEFS);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33327;Created on February 28th, 1940 in order to help Finland, CEFS eventually was assigned a knew task after the treaty of Moscow (March, 12th) bringing peace between Soviet Union and Finland. Associated to a british force, it was finally sent to Norway when Germany launched operation Weserubüng.\nThis expeditionnary corps was made of three french light divisions of mountain troops, a brigade from the Légion étrangère and also a polish brigade, assisted by small support troops:\n1ère Division Légère de Chasseurs (1ère DLCh)\n2ème Division Légère de Chasseurs (2ème DLCh)\n3ère Division Légère d'Infanterie (DLI)\n13ème Demi-Brigade de Marche de la Légion étrangère (13ème DBMLE)\nBataillon autonome de Chasseurs de Podhale\nCEFS launched attacks on Namsos and Narvik alongside british and norvegian troops from April 17th to June 8th were the last troops were reembarked to France. 2ème DLCh and 3ère DLI stayed in France because of the rapid advance of german forces after May 10th.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME33328;L’Infanterie de l’Air : French paratroopers creation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33328;Soviet development of paratroopers units impressed many countries such as France: the large scale exercise that took place in 1935 in Kiev led french general staff to autorise Capitaine Geille to open a formation center in France. Confirmed pilot and trained as paratrooper in the Soviet Union, Geille started in september 1935 the formation of french paratroopers in the Centre d'Instruction Parachustiste in Avignon. Two company-sized units, the 601ème and 602ème Groupe d'Infanterie de l'Air (GIA) were established respectivly in Reims and Baraki (Algeria).\nThese units were specially trained for dropping small combat groups behind the ennemy lines, using Potez 650 and Farman 224 transport planes. In september 1939, they were ready to jump on Walcheren (Nederlands) but were not engaged. Finally, they were used as "Corps Francs" under the command of the 28e Division d'infanterie alpine stationned in Alsace. They led patrols and ambushes behind ennemy lines during the Phoney war. They were transfered to North Africa and finally disbanded in August 1940.\nIn 1942, the experience of the GIA served in the creation of the 1er Régiment de chasseurs parachutistes (1er RCP) who choose the insigna of the former 601ème GIA.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33329;Formation of 10ème Armée;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33329;French 10ème Armée was set up on May 31th and tasked to hold a defensive line along the river Seine after german breaktrough of the Somme defenses. This army is placed under the command of general Robert Marie Altmayer, a former cavalry officier retired in 1937 and recalled at the outbreak of hostilities to command the 10ème Région militaire (Military sector around Paris).\nAltmayer could only rely on a few troops under three corps (3ème Corps d'Armée, Corps de Cavalerie motorisé, 25ème Corps d'Armée), totalizing 3 DLI, 1 DLC, 3 DLM, some tanks, cavalry and reconnaissance groups.\nThe 25ème Corps d’Armée was set up the day after and put under the command of general Sylvestre Audet.
EVTNAME33330;Formation of Corps de Cavalerie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33330;French Corps de Cavalerie (Cavalry Corps) was set up from september to december 1939 in order to command light mechanized divisions (DLM). Despite its name, it was a fully motorized army corps assigned to the 1ème Armée. Its commander was general René Prioux, former general general-inspector of cavalry forces.This corps was initially in charge of the 1ère DLM and 2ème DLM. When 1ère DLM joined the 7ème Armée in February 1940, it was replaced by the newly formed 3ème DLM.\nAccording to the Dyle-Breda manoeuver established by allied forces, Corps de Cavalerie was task to rapidly advance into Belgium, stop or delay german advancing forces and alloxw time for french divisions to set up a defensive line in Belgium.In May, Prioux’s forces are engaged in the batte of Hannut against Hoepner’s XVI. Armeekorps and are able de to inflict heavy losses (164 tanks destroyed, 30 damaged) before withdrawing.In June, after the being encircled in Dunkerque’s pocket, the motorized corps in reformed and assigned to Altmayer’s 10ème Armée, under command of general Langlois.The 3 remaining DLM, lacking of tanks, only could led delaying actions until the Armistice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

As general Robert Altmayer, commander of the 10ème Armée told in its memories : "Light Infantry Divisions (DLI), from recent formation, only had 2 infantry regiments (instead of 3) and 2 or 3 groups of artillery (instead of 5). They weren’t ‘light’ by nature of its constituting elements ; they were ‘small’ ; they were only ‘mixt brigades’."\n17ème DLI was under command of general René Darde.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME33340;Artillerie lourde sur voie ferrée (ALVF);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33340;French army did an extensive use of heavy railway artillery during WW1, building a massive force of 6 regiments (more than 500 guns) from scratch. After war, guns were grouped in a single regiment: the 152ème RAP. During the thirties, plans were made to use these guns behind the Maginot line. At the outbreak of hostilities, France mobilized 4 heavy railway artillery regiments ('Régiments d'Artillerie Lourde sur Voie Ferrée' - RALVF) totalizing 116 guns of various calibers. Main calibers were 400 mm Mle 1916. Most of these guns were captured by Germany, send to the Eastern Front in 1941 or used to equip the Atlantic wall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33341;Nationalization of french aircraft industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33341;Pierre Cot, secretary of the French Air Force, decreed that national security was too important for the production of warplanes to be left in the hands of the private enterprises therefore in July 1936 the French government began nationalizing many of the larger aircraft companies, creating six state-owned companies, which encompassed the majority of aeronautical production. However, the aircraft engine industry, even as it proved incapable of providing the badly needed powerful engines, escaped nationalization. Despite these efforts, french industry couldn't produce enough aircrafts and Pierre Cot turned to the USA to solve this issue buying american planes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33342;Buy american planes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33342;Talks started in the political circles : ambassador in France William Bullitt introduced Jean Monnet in the USA in February 1936. Monnet was tasked to pass a first command of 300 Curtiss P-36 "Hawk" fighters.\nNegociations focused on the low rate of production and exportation of aircrafts and met the opposition of the USAAC to sell abroad a home needed fighter. Curtiss also didn't want a french test pilot discover the secrets of the P-36. Monnet and Bullitt met J.D. Roosevelt on March 5th who intervene to facilitate negociations. A first command of 100 aircrafts was passed in May, under the Curtiss H.75 type A designation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33343;The Monnet-Hoppenot Mission;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33343;In consequence of the annexation of Sudetenland, France increased its rearmament efforts. French Président du Conseil Edouard Daladier asked Jean Monnet to command one thousand aircarfts. Monnet led this mission and bought 695 aircrafts for a total of  84.1 millions dollars. There was a scandal when the american press discovered the action of french negociators to buy US equipement. Roosevelt assumed his position arguing that this help to the French will also help the development of US industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME33346;The Jacquin-Thouvenot Mission;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33346;Negociations went on in 1939 to get more aircrafts from the US industry. In February 1939, both France and United Kingdom sent missions to buy new aircrafts. French deciders ordered 200 medium bomber aircrafts Martin 167 designed "F" for France (as the British ones were designed "B" or "Maryland").Jean Monnet went back to meet president Roosevelt in april 1939 to ensure that neutraly acts could be bypass and french commands honored. At the end of august 1939, the Jacquin-Thouvenot mission was ordered by Paul Reynaud to buy all the amrican aircrafts available. It ordered 1280 aircrafts at high costs (aircrafts have to be bought and at the same time french money financed the production lines). It was mainly fighters like the Curtiss H.75 and the brand new Curtiss P-40. War created a new environnement for these negociations. An Anglo-french coordinating committee ("Conseil anglo-français des fournitures de guerre") was also created in november 1939 by Jean Monnet with the autorisation of Edouard Daladier and Neuville Chamberlain, using the possibilities offered by the Cash and Carry act (November, 4th 1939).\n\nAlthough France passed commands for 2035 aircrafts and 8805 motors – at a cost of 337 millions dollars – only  655 aircrafts of various models (Glenn-Martin 167-F, North American BT9B, Douglas DB-7, Curtiss Hawk 75 and Chance Vought 156) were delivered. 469 were involved in combat. Because of french capitulation, other commands were shipped to England and reinforced the Royal Air Force during the Battle of Britain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME33350;French Curtiss H.75 in combat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33350;French Curtiss H.75 equiped five fighter units (Groupes de Chasse III/2, I/4, II/4, I/5 and II/5) and totalized 234 victories for the loss of 200 aircrafts in combat, accidents or capture by the ennemy between September 1939 and June 1940. \nGroupe de Chasse II/4 named "Les Petits Poucets" shot down the two first Me-109 on the Western front on September 8th, 1939. With that plane, french ace Lieutnant Edmond Marin la Meslée (Groupe de Chasse I/5) shot down 16 ennemy aircrafts making him the best french ace of the "Campagne de France".\nFrench Curtiss were still in service in the Vichy Air Force during the Torch operation (november 1942) were they faced Grumman F4F Wildcats from the US Navy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33351;Creation of the Armée de l'Air (French Air Force);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33351;L'Armée de l'Air (French Air Force) was created on April 1st, 1933 and became an independant armed branch on July 2nd, 1934. General Joseph Vuillemin was appointed at the head of the Air Force from February 1938 to the war.\nThis force was structured in two different commands:\n - Forces aériennes réservées (Reserved Air Forces) were under direct command of General Vuillemin and were to be engaged in the ground battle.\n - Forces aériennes de coopération (Cooperation Air Forces) were under the command of the Armée de Terre, assigned to each Army. They were composed of fighters, recon and artillery spotting aircrafts. In 1939, half fighter groups and recon groups of the Armée de l'Air were belonging to these Forces aériennes de coopération.\n\nTactical basic unit is a "Groupe" (Group – Squadron sized unit), composed of two or three "Escadrilles" (Flights), totalizing 24 fighters or 16-20 bombers and less recon aircrafts. 2 or 3 "Groupes" are assembled into an "Escadre" (Wing sized unit).\n Appartenance to an "Escadre" is still noticeable in the Squadron denomination: for example, GCII/1 means "Groupe de Chasse N°2" (Fighter Group N°2) attached to Première Escadre (1st Wing).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33352;Armée de l'Air - command reorganization (1);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33352;In an attempt to reorganize more efficiently its air forces, French High Command decided to disband in september 1939 the former district organization. It was replaced by 4 "Zones d'Opérations Aériennes" (Air Operations Areas): ZOAN (North), ZOAE (Est), ZOAS (South), ZOAA (Alps).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33353;Armée de l'Air - command reorganisation (2);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33353;Tensions between Army and Air Force provoked a new global reorganization of Air Forces Commmand. A new HQ - Forces Aériennes de Coopération du Nord-Est (FACNE), under command of general Marcel Têtu, was tasked to support ground forces. An important part of the air forces were sent back under army direct command, anihilating Vuillemin's efforts to create a independant force.\nBy the way, lack of coordination persisted in May and June 1940, preventing Armée de l'Air to have a significant impact in the battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33354;Launch the Richelieu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33354;Idea of Battleship class 'Richelieu' was launched in the mid-thirties to counter the development of italian navy who decided the construction of battleships Littorio and Vittorio Veneto. It was design to get its main armament (380 mm guns) in 2 front quadruple turrets, like the previous Dunkerque class battlecruiser. Richelieu was laid down in Brest on october 1935 but construction encountered multiple delays provocated by inadequate AA and secondary artillery. On June 18th, 1940, the ship escaped Brest to rally Dakar at 90% completion. Under Vichy command, Richelieu participate in Dakar's defense against british and free french attack (September 1940). After the allied landings in North Africa, Richelieu joined the Free France and was send in early 1943 in the New York Naval Yard to be refitted. Then she took part in the battles in the Indian Ocean alongside British Forces and participate in the First Indochina War before being scrapped in 1968.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME33355;Launch the Jean Bart!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33355;Jean Bart was the second Richelieu class battleship and the last battleship build by France. She was laid down in December 1936 in Saint-Nazaire and supposed to be launched in october 1940. Because of the german advance, construction work was accelerated and allowed the ship to escaped France in June 1940 and to be rebased in Casablanca. Vichy France lacked ressources to finish the Jean Bart which is finally damaged by the Allies during Operation Torch. The ship remained unachieved until 1955 when it entered in service, before being scrapped in 1970.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
