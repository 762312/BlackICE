# BlackICE for Hearts of Iron III
### This is the official repo for the mod.

### How to build a test version
There is a GitHub action which will create a Zipfile which includes a Zipfile of the mod (it's 2 Zipfiles stacked inside). The inner Zipfile then has to be extracted with the "extract here" in the BASE game folder (the folder with the "hoi3_tfh.exe"). It should ask to replace some files.
See the screenshots if you don't know how to start the action, and where to find the file.
