NEW STUFF

Strategic resources

Added trade options for most resources that can be mined. System is relatively simple. Each country that has tradeable strategic resource can
have two active trade deals that last one year each. AI will buy resources too, so player will have to realy hunt trade opportunities for more 
rare stuff (like Molybdenum for example). 
Each bought resource grants bonuses related to it. For example, if you buy tungsten, you will get Hard Attack bonus for the duration fo trade deal (if you have researched AT techs that is).
Trade deals with countries that you're at war with get automaticaly cancelled. 

Added new ones (molybdenum, copper, zinc, manganese )
Old ones got reworked. Now it's impossible to have strategic resources by simply being closesly alligned to country having them. You have to be allies, in faction or have a trade deal.
All new and some of the old ones got linked with various techs and modifiers. 
Also, not having some of them will trigger penalties, or prevent getting access to certain techs (jet techs without aluminium) or getting certain bonuses (air build speed without aluminium).


Budget events + national focus $$$ cost

Now having huge army/air forces/navy/industry will cost money. After reaching certain number of brigades/units/IC you will get events asking
if you want to pay for extra salaries, maintenance etc. Those events will trigger every 3 months. Their initial cost is relatively low, but
it will go up if you keep expanding army/air/sea/IC. Values are set in a way that allows certain level of expansion without having to worry about
money spending. 

Pavo ITA events ???
