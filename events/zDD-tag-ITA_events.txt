###DECSCRIPTION; From 1934-1939 Libya became an integral part to the Kingdom of Italy's plan to deal 
### with large population growth, poverty and unemployment in the south. The italian governemnt had 
### decided as early as 1911 that it should 'liberate' the former Roman province from tht Ottoman turks, 
### which led to the ITalo-Turkish war and the acquisition of the colonies of Cyrenaica, Tripolitanaia and 
### Fezzan from the Ottomans. In 1934 these were merged to form Italina Libya, which included concessions 
### obtained from British Sudan and territorial changes with Egypt. With the appointing of the Italian governor: 
### Italo Balbo, Italian Libya flourished -- the Italians in Libya numbered 108,419 (12.37% of the total population) 
### at the time of the 1939 census and the Italians in less than thirty years (1911-1940) built huge public works 
### (roads, buildings, ports, railways and opened up vast tracts of farmland). In March 1937 Mussolini made a state 
### visit to Libya, where he opened a new military highway running the entire length of the colony (the Via Balbia). 
### For propaganda reasons he had himself declared protector of Islam and was presented with a symbolic sword.
### Mussolini's publicized encouragement of the Arabic nationalist movement suited his wider policies of 
### confronting Britain and France.

###DECSCRIPTION; In 1939 Libya was incorporated into metropolitan Italy and thereafter considered an 
### integral part of the Italian state where the local population was granted a form of Italian citizenship. 
### By 1939, the Italians had built 400 km of new railroads and 4,000 km of new roads (the most important 
### one was the one from Tripoli to Tobruk, on the coast) in Libya. Libya's best land was allocated to the italian 
### settlers to be brought under productive cultivation, primarily in olive groves. Settlement was directed by a state corporation, 
### the Libyan Colonization Society, which undertook land reclamation and the building of model villages and offered a grubstake 
### and credit facilities to the settlers it had sponsored. The Italians made modern medical care available for the first time in Libya, 
### improved sanitary conditions in the towns, and undertook to replenish the herds and flocks that had been depleted during the war. 
### But, although Mussolini liked to refer to the Libyans as "Muslim Italians", little more was accomplished that directly improved 
### the living standards of the Arab population.
