# The national focus is a multi stage effect for the player.
# The longer you have a focus the better its effect will be.
# Changing focuses is not instant. It takes some time for the old of wear off, and the new to begin.
# It alone does not provide buildings, but if acting ministers match the focus, they will give buildings quicker.
# 

# Focus is set to a single variable called "national_focus"
# Mapped as follows:
#   1 = ground_forces
#   2 = air_force
#   3 = navy
#   4 = economy
#   5 = science
#   6 = health_education
#   7 = natural_resources


# Dummy event for testing purposes.
