# Marneman's Operation Britannia Rising (Liberation of England) Events
#
# History reveals nothing of an "Operation Britannia Rising".  However, had the Germans actually
# invaded and conquered England, there would not have been an Operation Overlord, at least not at
# first. More than likely, the USA would have moved to liberate England first, and deal with the
# rest of Europe later.  This event series is designed to fulfull that scenario, should the
# Germans succeed in a conquest of England prior to June 6, 1944 (D-Day).
