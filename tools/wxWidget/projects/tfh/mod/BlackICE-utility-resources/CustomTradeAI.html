    <p align="center">On this page you can create a custom trade AI logic.<br />If you want to use it you will have to
        toggle it here and<br />activate automated trade in the ingame diplomacy window.<br />Whenever the game
        calculates
        your trades it will use these values.</p>
    <p align="center"><strong>Daily surplus</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>if you are below the desired stockpile this will be the desired daily surplus</li>
        <li>if you are above the stockpile this value is ignored</li>
    </ul>
    <p align="center"><strong>Sell above</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>if you are above this then the AI will consider selling resources</li>
        <li>AI will sell up to a deficit of 'maxDailyDeficit'</li>
    </ul>
    <p align="center"><strong>Stockpile</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>the desired amount to have in the stockpile</li>
        <li>if you are above this value (+10%) all trades will be canceled</li>
    </ul>
    <p align="center">Money has no desired stockpile, instead it will always try to achieve 100-150% of the
        surplus.<br />There is no limit on how much supplies the AI will try to sell, so be careful that you don't sell
        all
        your IC.</p>
