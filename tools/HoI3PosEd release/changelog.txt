Changelog:

Beta 26.4
-the terrain.bmp is now matched with the provinces.bmp, if you save the terrain in the paint tool.
 Additional terrain will be painted with color 8 (forest).
 You have to restart the editor so see the changes.
 Rivers.bmp is matched in the same way btw.
 

Beta 26.3

-shift+F4 toggles visibility of the selected icon
-removed shift+F5 and shift+shift F6 hotkeys (use shift+F4 instead)

-you can add new buildings to the editor:
   create a textfile 'addbuildings.txt' in the editor folder and list the additional buildings
   For example:
   
   rocketaa,43,45
   bigbuilding,50,50
   
   The numbers define the size of the selection box (width, height)
   The editor looks for png-imagefiles with the same name (rocktaa.png, bigbuilding.png) in the editor folder.
   If it can't find such a file it uses a smilie :-)
   
-completely rewrote the positions.txt browser to make it more flexible
-if the region map is created you will see all regions in the status bar (instead of only the first)
-you can now 'r' select (this selects the whole region) a sea province (this was disabled before)
   
Beta 25

-added support for TFH and moddir
-added combobox to the launcher to select a mod
-added checkbox to the launcher to create a logfile (log.txt in the editor-directory)
-removed 'save position as' menu (not needed anymore I think)
-added "Total" info to the province details window (this is the sum of the ressource from the selected provinces)
  This can be used to see the total ressources of each country (select a province of a country and press 't')
-you can use now percentages for the +/- field in the province details window
  This is helpful, if you want to change the ressources of a country (only provinces with ressources are changed this way)
  For example: If you think Germany is underpowered and needs a little bit more IC, select a german province, press 't', select 'industry' from the combobox,
  type 50% in the +/- field (this adds 50%, which means 150% of the original value) and press the button to the right.
  Poor Germany has 209 IC now (this is not the exact value shown in the game).

Beta 24
-added undo/redo function (20 level) to the paint tool (use the buttons or ctrl+z / ctrl+y)
-provinces with the text #empty are ignored now too (I found a few in TFH)

Beta 23
-added a few checks to the region.txt file
-added terrain mode to the paint tool
-changed behaviour of the F8 key (toggles now between the last mapmode and the standard view)


Beta 22
-added adjacencies tab to the river crossing / adjacencies window
   -The red lines show the connection between the 'From' and the 'To' province,
    the yellow lines are connected with the 'Through' province, which also has a small rectangle at the unit position.
   -The 'Search sel. button' is used to search the selected province on the map in the adjacencies list.
    The search starts at the selected row and cycles through all entries, if you use the button repeatedly.
   -To edit the values you have to select a province and then use the 'From', 'To' or 'Through' button.
   -'CHANGE' will change the selected row, 'ADD' will add a new row using the values above, 'REMOVE' removes a line.
   -You can sort the columns by clicking the header
 
Beta 21.3
-added checkbox to show the river crossings for the selected province only

Beta 21.2
-added river crossing / adjacencies window
 (the adjacencies tab is empty at the moment)
 river crossing:
 Lines are calculated between all unit positions in adjacent land provinces.
 If a line touches a river, there is a river penalty for this provinces.

 

Beta 21
-added OOB browser (key: 'o')
   There are two windows (you can hide the right one by pressing the button with the two arrows at the top).
   You can navigate independently in the windows, except for the selection, which is the same for both.
   The changes are always made in the active (white background, blue bar) window.
   Attaching units is also possible in this windows (light green HQs).
   The tabbers show a few filters. The 'Land' tab also shows naval and air units attached to HQs (don't know, if I should remove them).
   You can change the country by selecting units (the first unit is used) on the map or typing the tag into the textfield.
   
   -shift+left click: adds / removes a unit from the selection
   -control+left click: selects the whole formation (and expands it too)
   -control+double click: collapses the formation
   -key: 'm' expand / collapse the OOB
   -key: 'f' goto selected unit
   -key: 'ESC' cancels attach



Beta 20.2
-province files with the text #duplicate# are ignored now
-added function to show unit-icons in all provinces (shift+control+F5)
  now it should be easier to spot overlapping units. If there is no position, you have to create one to move the icon!
-added a few colors to the unit cards in the selection window for better overview

Beta 20
-added detach (key: 'd') and attach (key: 'a') function:
  -you can detach and attach multiple units at once (attach works only if there aren't too many land units (5) in the formation, except for a theatre)
  -you can attach units even without detaching first
  -the distance shown is calculated between the first unit and the HQs
  -'***' behind the HQ name means that this HQ belongs to a selected unit
   (theoretically you can attach units to their own HQ. which means that they will be put at the end of the formation)

-added some status messages in the statusbar for detach and attach
-fixed a bug: the editor could crash if the left mousekey was pressed and the mouse moved out of the window


Beta 19_9
-fixed a bug in the region check (coastal provinces were ignored)
 Now there are some island provinces reported which haven't a direct connection to their region, but there is no way to avoid that.
-added more informations to the region check (single province region and coastal province)
-added unit selection window (F11):
  The leader files aren't used yet. There is only Rommel for testing.
  The selection works basically like in FTM:
  -you can multi select units by holding shift.
  -control click selects the hq and its units
  -you can deselect by clicking the X Button
  -the search function only searches for unit names yet. Leader will be added later.
  What does those letters mean?
  E=experience, S=strength, O=organisation, D= dig in
  If there is no number behind this, it means at least one brigade is using a variable
  
Beta 19_7
-added 'has picture' map mode which shows every province with a picture
-added hotkey shift+ctrl+p shows the picture of the selected province, if there is one
-added hotkey 'w' centers the map on the selected unit
 

Beta 19.6
-you can click now in the "river error" window. The map will be centered on the error location


Beta 19.5
-added error finder for rivers.bmp
 This will check for:
 + Isolated pixels
 + All pixel connected, no diagonal pixel: they must be actually connected
  (this will be reported as missing green pixel, because my tool thinks there is a new river starting (you will see it))
 + Start with a green pixel (#00FF00)
 + When two rivers are touching they must have a red pixel (#FF0000) where they touch AND the red pixel must be on a line, not on an edge
 + If there are too many pixels (the river is to thick)
   (sometimes there is a missing green pixel reported too, because my tool thinks there is a new river starting)

Beta 19.2
-added 'Ignore Capital' checkbox to the error search config window
-added 'Ignore unit in enemy province' checkbox to the OOB error report window

Beta 19.1
-added 'Search isolated pixels window'
 checks if every pixel in the province is touching either an ocean tile or another pixel of the said province
 
Beta 19
-added OOB error report window
It is not perfect, because it only checks the history\diplomacy\Alliances.txt and Puppetstates.txt (+expeditionary forces) and not the different factions.
Therefore some unnecessary lines are generated, but it's better than nothing I think.

Beta 18.5
-editing of multiple provinces at once at a specified date is possible now
 but be aware that the editor can't write correctly if there are more than one variables in a line like this:
 1943.2.1 = { anti_air = 1 coastal_fort = 2 }
 
-fixed a bug where typing in a date manually in the province details window could lead to a crash

Beta 18
-paint tool (shift+F11):
   -you can paint now rivers on the map
   -paint with the left or right mousekey
   -for erasing use the pink or the white color, doesn't matter which one (the last two colors in the table)
   -hotkey 'x' swaps the foreground and background colors
   -hotkey 'p' picks the color under the mouse cursor
   -to end the paint mode simply close the window
-you don't need simple.bmp anymore. The political map will be created automatically.

Beta 17.8
-added check for wrong positions of placed navalbases and coastalforts even if there is no position defined
-added support for the HPP mod (may work with other mods as well). The editor does now extend the gfx folder.
-added posibillity to change the position of the capital symbol
 (you have to create a position first to move the symbol)
 you can show all capitals by pressing F7
 -fixed a bug: you couldn't click on a place if there is a unit in the province even if the OOB isn't shown

Beta 17.5
-added 'save selected provinces to' button in the province details window
-new hotkey 't' adds a country to the selection (could take a while, if there are many provinces like in SOV)
-changed hotkey 'c' to 'x' (selection color). 'c' is reserved for further use
-fixed a bug: changing the date could cause a crash, if OOB is displayed
-fixed a bug with the order of the starting dates (the 1944 OOBs were shown on the 1941 map)
-expeditionary forces are getting the right flag now
-radar_stations can now be placed

Beta 17
-saving the OOB files is now possible:
  As always make a backup of your files and carefully check the OOB for errors.
  Comments in the unit part are removed, but not those at the beginning of the file.
  
-you can move units around now by right clicking a province:
  If there are naval or air units selected there will pop up a menu for further options.
  Air units can only move to a province with a air base (remember that you can show the icons with F7).
  If you want to move units in an uncontrolled province there will be a *FOREIGN* warning in the menu.
  You can't rebase cags yet. But they will move automatically with their carrier/fleet.

-added possibility to show only units of their country. You have to select a single unit and then press 'F6'
-control-click on a hq selects the hq and its subordinate units
-added hierarchy-lines like in the game (toggle on/off with 'h')

Beta 16
-added OOB view (hotkey F5)
 This works in conjunction with the starting dates in the province details window.
 In this view the selection changes basically to the ingame selection.
 You can select single units by clicking on them oder holding shift for multiselection.
 By holding down the left mouse key you will draw a selection box.
 Btw the 'c' key does change the selection color for the units too.
-if OOB view is on 'b' will toggle the selection mode (standard / box selection)
-changed hotkey for unit and underground icon visibility: now shift+F5 and shift+F6 (don't know, if someone uses this anyway)

-made mapmode lvl 7 green a bit darker

Beta 11
-owner, controller and add_core can now be changed in multiple provinces at once too
